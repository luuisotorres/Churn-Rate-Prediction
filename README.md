# About the Project

The churn rate is a metric that shows us the total percentage of clients who discontinue their subscriptions within a certain period.<br><br>
Understandably, a high churn rate could affect a company's profitablity and also impact growth, so it's important to keep track of a company's churn rate and try to identify patterns among clients who discontinue their subscripitons in order to develop strategies to reach these clients with a better service, bonuses or any other incentive to keep them as clients for a long period of time.<br><br>
In this project, I did an exploratory data analysis on a Telco dataset to find what the clients who left the company have in common and then I developed a machine learning model for churn prediction.
